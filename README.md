### Purpose and Use Case

**This tool could be particularly useful for marketers, product managers, or analysts interested in understanding consumer behavior patterns. For instance:**

    Newsletter Engagement vs. Download Behavior could help marketing teams decide if thereâ€™s a correlation between engagement with newsletters and interest in downloadable content, guiding strategies to boost downloads.
    Product Uniqueness vs. Purchase Likelihood could inform product development or branding teams about how much perceived uniqueness impacts purchase decisions, guiding product positioning strategies.


### Key Features
- **Dataset Selection**: Choose between two datasets to analyze:
  - **Newsletter Engagement vs. Download Behavior**: Examines whether reading a newsletter is associated with an increase in downloads.
  - **Product Uniqueness vs. Purchase Likelihood**: Assesses if perceived product uniqueness influences purchase likelihood.
- **Data Preview**: Displays a contingency table of the selected dataset to understand the distribution of values.
- **Chi-square Test Execution**: Runs the Chi-square test of independence on the selected dataset and displays the results, including:
  - Chi-square Statistic
  - p-value
  - Degrees of Freedom
  - Expected Frequencies
- **Interpretation of Results**: Provides a conclusion based on the p-value to help users understand if the association is statistically significant.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the interactive GUI
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **SciPy** for Chi-square test calculations
